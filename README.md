# OrdersPartly

Magento has this feature to ship partial items of any order, when you are shipping any order then you can set custom quantity 0 to ship for that item and some value for others which you want to ship. So, this extension will help you to identify: Orders partly like (invoice partly, credit-memo partly, shipment partly,...).
